# Reddit Bot - Birb Meme Bot

A bot that uses Reddit's API (PRAW) to automatically reply to users when it is called upon using a special keyword. The bot searches through several relevant subreddits (niche forums) looking for its special keyword. When the bot finds its special keyword, it replies to the user with a cute image of a bird. The purpose of this project was to reinforce my knowledge utilizing the python language.
